# BadWordFilter
[CodeProject Challenge](https://www.codeproject.com/Answers/1157928/Coding-challenge-bad-word-filter) to filter and replace words in a given input string.  These are my two solutions, the best being `BadWordFilter` due to less memory used and less regular expression compiling.  It calls `Regex` only once while my first solution `BadWordFilter2` called once per bad word in the dictionary.

Very static (the puns, oh my) program because I wanted to be cognizant that it needed to be easily viewable and understandable in a forum-post format.
